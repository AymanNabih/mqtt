== HiveMQ Client Scanner Plugin

=== Purpose

In order to use this MQTT broker plugin you first need a working {hivemq-link}[HiveMQ] MQTT broker.

This Client Scanner plugin for the {hivemq-link}[HiveMQ] MQTT broker publishes all changes to client stati (connected/disconnectd) as well as all changes to subscribed topics by these clients. 

=== What you'll get

This Client Scanner plugin implements the following HiveMQ Callbacks:

* A callback when a client connects
* A callback when a client disconnects
* A callback when a client subscribes a topic
* A callback when a client unsubscribes a topic

=== Trying the plugin from within the IDE

. Execute the +package+ goal from Maven with the profile _RunWithHiveMQ_ activated. (Need help?: Consult: {maven-documentation-profile-link}[The maven documentation])
. Now HiveMQ should be running *with* your plugin installed.
. Connect with a {hivemq-blog-tools}[MQTT client] of your choice and publish something. You should see some log output.

=== Next steps

* Read about the available HiveMQ callbacks {hivemq-callbacks-overview-link}[here]. (There are also low level protocol callbacks available. See {github-low-level-callbacks}[https://github.com/hivemq/hivemq-spi/tree/master/src/main/java/com/dcsquare/hivemq/spi/callback/lowlevel])
